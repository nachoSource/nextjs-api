This project is meant to emulate the functioning of a basic deposit/withdrawal bank API using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Even though the application matches the assigned requirement, it is to take into account that several things are acknowledged by the developer as in need for optimization, as you may notice when seeing the TODO items that are spread along the code.  
From having global styles to including stronger security validations, further refactor should rewrite part of this implementation to match best practices and improve code legibility.

Since I have worked with [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/nextjs) and global state management and I also had the opportunity to get to know Next.js but never with both of them at the same time, the required state management using a framework that explicitly discourages the use global state was taken as a personal challenge to continue evolving in my personal career.
However, I believe that cleaner ways to handle API responses and interaction between store slices could be found with some more time of my own.

Being said that, I will stay tuned for any review, observation or change request that allows me to do thing better :).
